# sudoku

The standard size grid for Sudoku is 9 x 9 with there being 9 smaller segments of 3 x 3.

The player must enter numbers (1-9) in the empty cells with the end goal being that the grid is filled with numbers such that each row, column, and segment only contain numbers 1-9, with no repetitions. 

A valid solution for a 9x9 board is one in which:
1) each row contains numbers 1-9 with no duplicates
2) each column contains numbers 1-9 with no duplicates
3) each 3x3 segment contains numbers 1-9 with no duplicates
